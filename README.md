grunt-tessel
============

> Grunt tasks to aid tessel development

This project adds two tasks to your grunt: `blacklist-dev-deps` and `tessel-push`.

### tessel-push

This task pushes code to your tessel. By default, it looks in the `main` field of your `package.json` and deploys that. 

```js
```
